# Tasks Manager
Angular 6 and Spring Boot 2.0.2 are currently industry frameworks that have changed how developers in the Web front-end 
and back-end develop Web applications. In this project, we take a close look into integrating the two to work as a single unit. 
The two frameworks are built separately, in the case of a team environment, thereafter the build process packages the application into a single coherent JAR file.
